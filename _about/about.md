<span style ="font-size:.9em;"> Welcome to my academic website! I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at <strong>University of Cincinnati</strong>. My research interests include Urban Economics, Economics with AI, Public Economics and Real Estate Economics. Feel free to explore my pages for more information about my research, teaching, and CV. I also often try to provide code and data related to my latest projects. In my free time, I enjoy hitting the gym, reading obscure books, and doing things with my hands (and legs... I like sports).

<span style ="font-size:.9em;"> I will be on the academic job market in Fall 2025.  </span>
